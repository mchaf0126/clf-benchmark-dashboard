## CLF WBLCA Benchmark Study v2 - Dashboard
This is a public repository containing the code required to run the CLF Dashboard as part of the CLF WBLCA Benchmark Study V2. This is a fork of the LCL dashboard found [here](https://wblca-benchmark-v2.lifecyclelab.org).

## About this study
In 2017, the Carbon Leadership Forum (CLF) at the University of Washington published the [Embodied Carbon Benchmark Study V1](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/lca-benchmark-database/) and [Visualization Tool](https://carbonleadershipforum.org/embodied-carbon-benchmark-study-data-visualization/). Since then, the practice of whole-building life cycle assessment (WBLCA) has grown rapidly, and it became clear that more robust and reliable benchmarks are critical for advancing work in thisfield. This project fills a critical gap and helps enable architects, engineers, policy makers, and the entire design community to work towards realistic and measurable embodied carbon reductionsat the building scale. TBD!
